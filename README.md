# Linear SVM Visualizer

An interactive educational web app that demonstrates how linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) work. Built with **Svelte** and **Vite**, it allows users to explore the concepts of hard and soft SVMs, support vectors, and margin optimization through hands-on manipulation of parameters and decision boundaries.

## üîç Overview

This tool visualizes the behavior of linear SVM classifiers. It highlights:

- The concept of maximum margin classifiers.
- The role of support vectors.
- The optimization objectives for hard and soft SVMs.
- How changing weights (\(\vec{w}\)) affects classification boundaries.

MathJax is used to render mathematical equations on the page, enhancing clarity for mathematical concepts.
